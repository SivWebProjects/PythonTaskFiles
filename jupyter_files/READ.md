This folder contains pandas tasks and sentimental analysis tasks.
1) Pandas Task:- I took a csv file of purchase data. I found total number of people, (number of unique items, average purchase price, 
                total number of purchases, total revenue) in purchasing analysis by total and by gender, and percentage and count in gender demographics by gender.
2) Sentimental Analysis Task:- I took a text file of restaurant reviews. It has six emotions: anger, sadness, love, surprise, joy, and fear. These labels are divided 
                               into two categories: positive reviews (love, joy, and surprise) and negative reviews (fear, anger, and sadness). After converting the data 
                               into vectors with a bag of words, divide it into train and test sets and train the random forest classifier model on the train data and 
                               predict on the test set, which gives a 95% accuracy.
