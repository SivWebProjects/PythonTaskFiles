I took people who had properly worn masks and improperly dataset. I have less data for people who have worn their mask incorrectly. I used image augmentation to 
increase the size of the dataset. I separated the data into train and test sets. After preprocessing step, construct the cnn layer, compile it, train the model 
on the train set, and validate the model on the test set. After that, make a prediction using a single image.
